Welcome to the official GitHub repository of KSPPS Melati (Koperasi Simpan Pinjam dan Pembiayaan Syariah). This repository contains documentation, resources, and code related to our cooperative organization focused on empowering the local economy and providing microfinance and financial services.

## About KSPPS Melati

KSPPS Melati traces its origins back to 1997 when the Yayasan Bakti Sosial Melati Foundation, in collaboration with ICMI Kabupaten Wonosobo, embarked on the journey to establish a Microfinance Institution, known as "Baittul Maal Wat Tamwil" (BMT). The BMT aimed to empower the community economically and began with 25 members dedicated to developing the local economy. Activities were centered around nurturing various community-based businesses within the Desa Sedayu, Kec. Sapuran, Kab. Wonosobo region, including Home Industri Opak (cassava crackers), Tempe production, Poultry Farming, and Farmers' groups.

In 1999, BMT officially transformed into a cooperative, named "Koperasi Serba Usaha Baittul Maal Wat Tamwil (KSU BMT) Melati." The cooperative was legally established to foster the growth of community businesses and local traders in markets and residential areas. Over the years, KSPPS Melati has consistently grown, playing a pivotal role in the local community's prosperity.

As the cooperative's focus evolved towards financial services, in 2008, KSU BMT Melati underwent a significant transformation, transitioning from a Cooperative of Various Businesses (Koperasi Serba Usaha) to a Sharia Financial Services Cooperative (Koperasi Jasa Keuangan Syariah or KJKS), following member consensus. Further transformation occurred in 2015, when the cooperative transitioned into KSPPS Melati (Koperasi Simpan Pinjam Pekerja Seni Melati), reaffirming its commitment to financial services rooted in sharia principles.
